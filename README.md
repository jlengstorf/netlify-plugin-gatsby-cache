# Netlify Build Plugin: Persist the Gatsby Cache Between Builds

Persist the Gatsby cache between Netlify builds for huge build speed improvements! ⚡️

> NOTE: [Netlify Build Plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/plugins/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache-jl&utm_campaign=devex) are in beta.

## Usage

To install, add the following lines to your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"

[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache"
```

Note: The `[[plugins]]` line is required for each plugin, even if you have other plugins in your `netlify.toml` file already.

This plugin determines the location of your `.cache` folder by looking at the `publish` folder configured for Netlify deployment (this _must_ be set in your `netlify.toml` in the `[build]` section). This means that if your Gatsby site successfully deploys, it will be cached as well with no config required! 🎉

## How much of a difference does this plugin make in build times?

Each Gatsby site is different, so build times vary widely between them, but one common slowdown in Gatsby builds is processing and transforming images. Gatsby is smart enough to check if these transformations have already been done and skip them, but in order to get that benefit in a build pipeline (e.g. Netlify) the `public` and `.cache` directories need to be preserved between builds. That’s what this plugin does!

| * 231 GraphQL queries<br>* 1,871 images<br>* 224 pages     | 293207ms ([build log](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lengstorf/deploys/5dceed27d58a580008daaccc))        | 72835ms ([build log](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lengstorf/deploys/5dcef2463da4810008d48aaa))         | 75%     |
| * 5 GraphQL queries<br>* No image processing<br>* 32 pages | 22072ms ([build log](https://app.netlify.com/sites/build-plugin-test/deploys/5dceed49e746a200091c76fe)) | 15543ms ([build log](https://app.netlify.com/sites/build-plugin-test/deploys/5dceedbfad95d0000bcd46d1)) | 30%     |

tl;dr: Repeat builds with lots of images will be _much_ faster. With few or no images, the difference will be there, but it won’t be as pronounced.
